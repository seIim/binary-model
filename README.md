This is a model that samples empirical distributions for the orbital parameters of binary stars.

Once we sample an orbit state, i.e. period, mass ratio, Euler angles, eccentricity, we can evolve the orbits over time.

This is all done in spencer2017.py, with a commented usage case in spencer2017::main().
